  description: `
    <p>The Orbitians is&nbsp;a&nbsp;collection of&nbsp;10,000 unique NFTs on&nbsp;the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
    <p>There are all sorts of&nbsp;beings in&nbsp;the NFT Universe. The most advanced and friendly of&nbsp;the
    bunch are Orbitians. They live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;metal space machines, high up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the sky and only have
    one foot on&nbsp;Earth.</p>
    <p>These Orbitians are a&nbsp;peaceful race, but they have been at&nbsp;war with a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;invaders for
    many generations. The invaders are called Upside-Downs, because of&nbsp;their inverted bodies that live on&nbsp;the
    ground, yet do&nbsp;not know any other way to&nbsp;be. Upside-Downs believe that they will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;win
    this war if&nbsp;they could only get an&nbsp;eye into Orbitian territory, so&nbsp;they&rsquo;ve taken to&nbsp;make
    human beings their target.</p>
